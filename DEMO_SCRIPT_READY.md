# üé¨ DEMO RECORDING - READY TO RECORD CHECKLIST

## ‚úÖ PRE-RECORDING VERIFICATION (COMPLETE!)

Your system just demonstrated perfect functionality:
- ‚úÖ Flask app starts successfully 
- ‚úÖ OpenAI + Google AI clients initialized
- ‚úÖ Database connected and working
- ‚úÖ Live query "latest ml news" completed successfully
- ‚úÖ Found 3 sources, extracted content, generated report
- ‚úÖ Google AI fallback working when OpenAI quota exceeded
- ‚úÖ Web interface responsive and professional

## üéØ EXACT DEMO SCRIPT TO FOLLOW

### **PHASE 1: INTRODUCTION (0:00-0:20)**

**Actions:**
1. Show VS Code with project open
2. Point to file structure briefly
3. Open terminal

**Script:**
> "Hi, I'm demonstrating my AI Research Agent for the Atlas Guild internship. This intelligent system combines exactly two tools as required: Tavily web search and content extraction, integrated with LLM analysis for structured research reports."

### **PHASE 2: START APPLICATION (0:20-0:35)**

**Actions:**
1. In terminal, run: `python app.py`
2. Show successful initialization logs
3. Open browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000

**Script:**
> "Let me start the web application. As you can see, the system initializes both OpenAI and Google AI clients for redundancy, connects to the SQLite database, and starts the Flask web server successfully."

### **PHASE 3: SHOW EXISTING DATA (0:35-0:50)**

**Actions:**
1. Show the main interface
2. Point to the reports list showing 4 existing reports
3. Click on one existing report to show structure

**Script:**
> "Here's the professional web interface. You can see four completed research reports already stored in the database, demonstrating the persistent storage capability. Let me show you the structure of an existing report."

### **PHASE 4: LIVE DEMONSTRATION (0:50-2:15)**

**Actions:**
1. Go back to main page
2. Enter new query: "Future of artificial intelligence 2025"
3. Click Search
4. Show real-time progress as system:
   - Finds sources via Tavily
   - Extracts content from each source
   - Generates report via LLM

**Script:**
> "Now let me demonstrate with a live query. I'll search for 'Future of artificial intelligence 2025'. Watch the real-time progress as the system finds relevant sources using the Tavily API, extracts clean content from each webpage, and then uses the LLM to generate a comprehensive structured report."

### **PHASE 5: SHOW RESULTS (2:15-2:45)**

**Actions:**
1. When report completes, click to view it
2. Scroll through the generated summary
3. Show key findings section
4. Point to source links at bottom

**Script:**
> "Excellent! Here's the generated report with an AI-powered executive summary, key findings extracted from multiple sources, and direct links to all analyzed content. The system successfully processed multiple sources and synthesized this professional analysis."

### **PHASE 6: WRAP-UP (2:45-3:00)**

**Actions:**
1. Navigate back to reports list
2. Show updated count (now 5 reports)
3. Mention GitHub repository

**Script:**
> "The system maintains a complete history of all research queries with persistent storage. This demonstrates a fully functional AI agent that meets all Atlas Guild requirements. The complete source code and documentation are available on GitHub. Thank you for reviewing my AI Research Agent."

## üìã RECORDING SETUP CHECKLIST

### **Before You Start Recording:**
- [ ] Close all unnecessary browser tabs/applications
- [ ] Clear desktop of clutter
- [ ] Test microphone audio levels
- [ ] Ensure Flask app is NOT running (you'll start it during demo)
- [ ] Have VS Code open with project loaded
- [ ] Have browser bookmarked to http://127.0.0.1:5000
- [ ] Prepare your recording software (OBS/Game Bar/etc.)

### **Demo Query Options:**
Choose ONE of these for your live demo:
1. **"Future of artificial intelligence 2025"** ‚Üê RECOMMENDED
2. **"Climate change solutions 2025"**
3. **"Latest cybersecurity trends"**
