# AI Research Agent - Atlas Guild Internship Assignment

An intelligent AI agent that searches the web, extracts content, and generates structured research reports using exactly 2 tools as specified in the assignment:

1. **Web Search API**: Tavily API for finding relevant sources
2. **Content Extractor**: trafilatura (HTML) + pypdf (PDFs) for clean text extraction

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is designed as a modular AI agent with clear separation of concerns. Here's how it works in plain words:

1. **User submits a research query** through the web interface
2. **Search Tool finds 2-3 relevant sources** using Tavily API
3. **Content Extractor downloads and cleans text** from each source (HTML/PDF)
4. **LLM generates a structured report** summarizing the findings
5. **Database stores everything** for future reference
6. **Web interface displays results** and allows browsing past reports

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Error Handling Strategy

The system implements comprehensive error handling at every level:

- **Search Failures**: Graceful fallback when no sources found
- **Extraction Errors**: Skip problematic URLs and continue with available sources
- **API Rate Limits**: Appropriate timeouts and retry mechanisms
- **Content Issues**: Handle malformed HTML/PDF gracefully
- **Network Problems**: Robust HTTP client with proper timeout handling

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Research queries with status tracking
research_queries (id, query, timestamp, status, sources_found, sources_extracted, error_message)

-- Source URLs and extraction results  
sources (id, query_id, url, title, content, extraction_success, extraction_error)

-- Generated reports with structured data
reports (id, query_id, summary, key_points, methodology, limitations, sources_analyzed)
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Content Extraction**: Truncates overly long content to stay within LLM token limits
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries for fast report retrieval
- **Concurrent Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple extraction tasks
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of temporary files and network connections

## 🤖 AI Assistance
